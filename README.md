# Simple-PyTorch-implementation-of-Semantic-Segmentation-CNNs
PyTorch Implementation of Semantic Segmentation CNNs: This repository features key architectures (from scratch) like UNet, DeepLabv3+, SegNet, FCN, and PSPNet. It's crafted to provide a solid foundation for Semantic Segmentation tasks using PyTorch.

## Supported Architectures and Backbones

- **[UNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)**: No backbone needed.
- **[DeepLabv3+](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02611v3)**: Support for ResNet backbones (ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, and ResNet101).
- **[PSPNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01105)**: Support for ResNet backbones (ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, and ResNet101).
- **[FCN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4038)**: Support for VGG backbones (VGG11, VGG13, VGG16, and VGG19).
- **[SegNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00561)**: No backbone needed.

## Optimizers and Learning Rate Schedulers

- **Optimizers**: Adam, SGD, and RMSprop.
- **Learning Rate Schedulers**: StepLR, PolyLR, and ReduceLROnPlateau.

## Loss Functions

- **Cross Entropy (variations)**:
  -  Standard CE
  - CE with class weights
  - Focal Loss
- **Dice Loss**
- **Joint loss**: Conjunction of Dice loss with one of the CE variations (as a Joint Loss). 

## Evaluation Metrics

- Models are evaluated using:
  - **Dice** Coefficient
  - Intersection over Union **(IoU)** score.

## Dataset

A mock dataset is included in the repository for demonstration and testing purposes. Note that this dataset is not aimed to be used for training/testing, but rather for setting up and debugging for the first run, a convenience.


## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following packages installed:

- `torch`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `Pillow`
- `tqdm`
- `torchvision`

You can install them by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Alternatively, you can manually install each package using:
```bash
pip install torch matplotlib numpy Pillow tqdm torchvision
```


## Training and prediction:

Modify the `config.py` file as needed, including dataset paths, then Run train.py directly or Execute the training script using the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

Modify the attributes of the Args class in `predict.py` file as needed, (including path for testing images, model weights, and prediction network parameters), then Run predict.py directly or Execute the prediction script using the following command:

```bash
python predict.py
```
